The file `code/data/experiments/conv_lstm/version_0/checkpoints/Epoch-epoch=58-ENS-EarthNetScore=0.3247.ckpt` contains the weights of the model that was used to produce most of the results from the paper:
1. It is the model compared to the baselines (Table 1).
2. It is one of the 5 models from the `RGBNIR + WEATHER + DEM` section (Table 2). 
3. It is the model used to perform simulations by perturbing the weather variables, both from the paper (Table 3) and this repository.
